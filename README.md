This notebook provides the search for a finite group of order greater than 2 such that there exists only one
element that is not a commutator. This provides a positive answer to problem 17.76 in the Kourovka notebook.

## How to run
The only requirement is the Groups, Algorithms, and Programming (GAP) v4 and a corresponding Jupyter notebook. Instructions
